        Football is much more than just a game for me, it is a deeply rooted passion that punctuates my life. Ever since I was a child, the sound of a ball being hit, the roar of the crowd and the palpable excitement of a game have always captivated me. Every match is an epic adventure, an opportunity to feel a range of emotions, from pre-match anticipation to the exhilarating joy of a goal and even the disappointment of defeat. My love for football is not limited to watching matches, it extends to playing on the field with friends, discussing tactics and player performances, and collecting memorabilia from memorable matches

        My passion for boxing was a revelation, an intense and rewarding experience that I pursued with fervor for 7 months. This sport has given me more than just physical skills. He pushed me to discover an inner strength I never imagined. Each training session was a challenge, an opportunity to surpass myself, push my limits and learn techniques that required concentration and precision. Boxing also instilled in me important values, such as discipline, respect and perseverance.

        Tennis was a passion that lit up my life for three wonderful years as an amateur. It’s an exhilarating sport that gave me a feeling of freedom on the court. Each racquet stroke was a careful dance between power and finesse, between brute force and subtlety of shots. My love for tennis was not only limited to the competition, but also to the elegance of the game, the strategy and the constant search for perfection. It was an experience that pushed me to push myself, train hard and refine my technical skills.
