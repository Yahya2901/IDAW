HTML is the standard mark-up language used to create and structure the content of web pages. It is made up of elements and tags that define the structure and content of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images and more. HTML is a static language, which means that web pages created with HTML are generally fixed documents that do not change according to the user's actions.

PHP, on the other hand, is a server programming language widely used for dynamic web development. Unlike HTML, PHP can be used to create interactive, personalised web pages. It can be integrated directly into HTML code to generate dynamic content, manage forms, access databases and much more. PHP runs on the server side, which means that the PHP code is processed on the server before the result is sent to the user's browser, enabling interactive and personalised websites to be created. Modern websites often use a combination of HTML, PHP, and other technologies to deliver a rich and dynamic user experience.

CSS is a style sheet language used to define the presentation and layout of web pages created in HTML. Whereas HTML is used to structure the content of a web page, CSS is used to control its appearance, including colours, fonts, margins, spacing, layout and other visual aspects.

CSS rules are applied to HTML elements via selectors, which allow specific elements to be targeted and styles to be applied to them. CSS offers great flexibility, allowing you to customise the design of a web page extensively, while maintaining a clear separation between content (HTML) and presentation (CSS). There are also advanced techniques in CSS, such as media queries for responsive design, animations, transitions, and many others, which can be used to create modern, attractive websites.
